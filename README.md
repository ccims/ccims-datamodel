# domain-meta-model

The meta model for the ccims

The model was created using [Eclipse Papyrus](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) 
and should only be edited by it.

The file [CCIMS-Metamodel.uml](uml/CCIMS-Metamodel.uml) is a [XMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Metadata_Interchange) compatible reprepresentation of the model.

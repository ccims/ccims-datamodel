#  ccims-datamodel

The datamodel for the ccims.

The domain meta model can be found on the branch [domain-meta-model](https://github.com/ccims/ccims-datamodel/tree/domain-meta-model)

The model was created using [Eclipse Papyrus](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) 
and should only be edited by it.

The file [ ccims-datamodel.uml ](uml/ccims-datamodel.uml) is a [XMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Metadata_Interchange) compatible reprepresentation of the model.
